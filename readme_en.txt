Introduction

What is this?

Tihs is a tool for making the visual interface of Windows quickly on
Ruby.

What can do it?

It can make a Form.

It can put control on Form.

It can put control on a container like a panel or a group box.

It can move and size change of control (by drag and drop or value
change in the Inspect window), and can delete of it (by right click).

It can change the attribute of control.(caption,name e.t.c)

It can change the font of control (being a button from the Inspect
window).

It can change the style of control (being a button from the Inspect 
window).

It can put the templated menu  which FormDesigner made. (Now, the 
template is only one)

It can edit the menu (being a button from an Inspect window).

It can edit the item of control with items, such as Toolbar or 
TabbedPanel.

It can do the check and execution of a script which you made 
(however, the user code can not be executing).

It can add some modules to control

It can edit the method argument of a common dialog which is module.

It can read and write the above thing as a ruby source file.

It can  edit by starting an editor (which can choose your favorite 
one by Preference Dialog).

It can write out the event of control to a clip board.

It can also write out methods to a clip board.

When the editor is started from FormDesigner, an editor becomes 
foreground in the double click of an item.

It outputs the prototype of a user code, since the user code was 
separated.

It can be made to reflect in a user code, when the control which 
needs a module during user code editing.

There is a tool for bit map resource creation in it.

How to install?

It needs Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
(I recommend ActiveScriptRuby 1.8.1.0 or later)
http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-PaloAlto/9251/ruby

It needs vruby and swin of the newest version. (The present newest 
versions are vrswin030906 and vruby031014)
http://www.osk.3web.ne.jp/~nyasu/software/vrproject.html

Please download and install them first.

Next, please unzip fdvr040303.zip to a some directory.

Installation is only them.

How to use it?

In order to start FormDesigner, please perform "FormDesigner.rb" in 
the directory from Ruby.

e.g. "ruby FormDesigner.rb"

If ActiveScriptRuby is installed, it will start by double-clicking 
"FormDesigner.rb".

If it starts and three windows appear, please operate and try the 
button and so on in it.

Good Luck !!
